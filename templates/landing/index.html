    <br>

    <p class="text">Online health forums are becoming popular among those who seek health care information in Turkey. Despite this popularity, their users do not usually have enough health literacy for assessing the quality of this information. The aim of our project is to improve our understanding of the extent and mechanisms under which health forums impact the quality of available knowledge necessary to make informed decisions on health issues. Delineating these mechanisms can provide the guidelines for an informatics system that produces high quality knowledge with the help of health care experts, while not overlooking the discursive and empowering potentials of the user generated content. </p> 
<br>
    <p class="text">We adopt a participatory action research methodology for exploring the challenges that Turkish stakeholders face and seeking possible solutions. Text mining techniques are used to collect and summarize the content in health forums for informing the different processes of action research. As part of our project deliverables, we have designed a set of preliminary Python scripts to mine available health data from forums and news sources.</p>
<br>
    <p class="text">Funded by The British Academy (Newton Advanced Fellowship Scheme), our project has commenced in September 2018 and currently scheduled to end in August 2021 (end date is subject to Covid-19 circumstances)</p>
